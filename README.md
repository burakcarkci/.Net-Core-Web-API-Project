# .Net-Core-Web-API-Project
I will build a full REST API using .NET Core 3.1. Iâ€™ll employ MVC, REST, the Repository Pattern, Dependency Injection, Entity Framework, Data Transfer Objects, (DTOs), AutoMapper to provide 6 API endpoints that will allow us to Create, Read Update and Delete resources.
